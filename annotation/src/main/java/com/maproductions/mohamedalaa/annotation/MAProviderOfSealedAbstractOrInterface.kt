package com.maproductions.mohamedalaa.annotation

/**
 * - Has same effect as [MASealedAbstractOrInterface], **But** used with classes that you don't own,
 * Which means you can't annotate them with [MASealedAbstractOrInterface], so when you use other
 * 3rd party library or even another library module in the same project add the needed classes in
 * this annotation isa, instead of [MASealedAbstractOrInterface] since you don't own them isa.
 *
 * - Note annotated class with this annotation will be ignored, yet it will be accessed so after
 * compilation the unused lint warning won't appear isa, However you still can annotate it
 * with [MASealedAbstractOrInterface] in case you want it to be annotated with it isa.
 *
 * ## How to Use
 *
 * 1. Create a data class or any class with properties of classes that you want them to be specially
 * converted to json (i.e. abstract classes), if any of the classes has type param(s) just use '*'
 * which is any class isa.
 *
 * 2. Annotate that data class with this annotation isa.
